## Understanding Number Bases
A Base determines the number of unique digits and the value of each position and the value each position in a numerical system represents. We count with Base10; 0-9 then resets at 10.

For example, in the number 352:

2 is in the ones place (which is 10 ^ 0)
5 is in the tens place (which is 10 ^ 1)
3 is in the hundreds place (which is 10 ^ 2)

Computers work in Base 2, 0 and 1. 

In the binary number 1011:

The rightmost 1 is in the "ones" place (which is 2 ^ 0),
The next 1 is in the "twos" place (which is 2 ^ 1),
The 0 indicates no value in the "fours" place (which is 2 ^ 2),
The leftmost 1 is in the "eights" place (which is 2 ^ 3).
